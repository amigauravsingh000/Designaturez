if (room.type === "bedroom" && room.area < 100) {
  suggest("Consider at least 100 sq ft for comfortable bedroom");
}

if (room.type === "kitchen" && !adjacentTo(room, "diningRoom")) {
  suggest("Kitchen adjacent to dining room improves convenience");
}

  suggest("North entrance: Consider pooja room near entrance (Vastu)");
}
```

### Auto-Correction

```javascript
// Example: Auto-fix common issues
if (utilization > 90%) {
  // Automatically suggest reducing room sizes
  autoOptimizeRoomSizes()
}

if (vastuScore < 50) {
  // Offer auto-correction
  offerVastuOptimization()
}
```

### Template System

```javascript
// Pre-designed templates
const templates = {
  "2BHK_eastFacing": {
