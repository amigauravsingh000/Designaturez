## 🚀 Technical Implementation

### State Management:

```javascript
// Floor assignment state in RoomsStep
const [roomFloorAssignments, setRoomFloorAssignments] = useState({});

// Update both local and context state
const handleFloorAssignment = (roomKey, floor) => {
  setRoomFloorAssignments((prev) => ({ ...prev, [roomKey]: floor }));
  updateRoomFloorAssignment(roomKey, floor);
};
```

### Recommendation Logic:

```javascript
const getIdealFloor = (roomType, roomIndex) => {
  if (floors === 1) return 0;

  switch (roomType) {
    case "bedroom":
      return roomIndex === 0 ? 0 : 1; // Master on ground
    case "balcony":
      return floors > 1 ? 1 : 0; // Upper floors
    case "kitchen":
    case "diningRoom":
    case "livingRoom":
      return 0; // Common areas on ground
    // ... etc
  }
};
```

### Floor Change UI:

```javascript
<button onClick={() => updateRoomFloorAssignment(room.key, newFloor)}>
  {floor === 0 ? "Ground Floor" : `Floor ${floor + 1}`}
</button>
```
