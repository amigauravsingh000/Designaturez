**Solution**: Make sure you have Node.js 16+ installed. Run `node --version` to check.

**Solution**: Vite will automatically try port 3001, 3002, etc. Or kill the process using port 3000.

### Issue: Tailwind styles not working

**Solution**:

1. Check if `postcss.config.js` and `tailwind.config.js` exist
2. Restart the dev server (`Ctrl+C` then `npm run dev`)

### Issue: Icons not showing
